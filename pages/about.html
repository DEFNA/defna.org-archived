<p>Django Events Foundation North America (DEFNA) is a non-profit based in California USA. It was formed
in 2015 at the request of the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/">Django Software Foundation</a> (DSF) to
run DjangoCon US. The DSF have licensed DEFNA to run DjangoCon US for 2015 and 2016. Beyond DjangoCon US we also plan
to be involved with other events in North America that cover the education and outreach of Django.</p>
